                <p>Hello! My name is Eden! <br> 
                I am trained as a microbiologist, and my ultimate goal in life is to use technology and science together to progress medicine. <br>
                I love the smaller things in life, going out for a walk, sitting on discord and talking with my friends, spending time with my partner and my furbabies. <br>
                I'm very excited to learn software development, starting with HTML/CSS/Javascript with the eventual goal of learning Python.</p>
           <div id="Hobby">
            <h4>My cat family</h4>
                <p>Here are some picture of my two fur babies, they mean the world to me!</p>

            <div id="Hobby2">
            <h4>Video Games</h4>
                <p>I have a few hobbies, I love art, drawing, painting, crochet, any craft of any sort will hold my interest! <br>
                I also love cooking, I love to find recipes and make them my own, cooking in itself can be an artform for me. <br>
                However I spend most of my time playing video games with my friends, in particular FFXIV(Final Fantasy 14 MMO by SquareEnix) takes most of my free time. <br> 
                My main friend group are the Peppers! There are many of us but here is a lovely picture of three of us.</p>
